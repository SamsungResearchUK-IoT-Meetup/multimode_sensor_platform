class HDC_Sensor:
    """
    A pythonic HDC (Temperature and Humidity sensor HDC280) driver for micropython

    This is based on the HDC2080 class defined at Micropython here: https://pybd.io/hw/tile_sensa.html#hdc-temperature-and-humidity-sensor

    The driver knows how to talk I2C to the tile HDC sensor on the board. It uses the I2C address and register values to fetch humidity and
    temperature data from the tile. Every time the object reads a value it checks to see if this is the highest or lowest value, if it is
    it records this for max/min values.
    At the time of writing none of the other methods have been written yet.

    The HDC object has internal state for:
     - number of activations since it was active.
     - the time stamp in UCT time when the object was created.
     - a method to GET the current temperature of sensor.
     - a method to GET the humidity of the sensor.
     - a method to GET maximum temperature recorded by the HDC sensor object (not the maximum of the sensor)
     - a method to GET minimum temperature recorded by the HDC sensor object (not the minimum of the sensor)
     - TODO a method to start polling the temperature sensor to record on SD card
     - TODO a method to start polling the humidity sensor to record to SD card
     - TODO a method to set polling in seconds between 1 and 10 seconds.
     - TODO a method to stop polling humidity sensor.
     - TODO a method to stop polling temperature sensor.
     - TODO a method to fetch all temperature readings in  a JSON format.
     - TODO a method to fetch all humidity readings in a JSON format.
     - TODO bring logging into this module.
