# Sensor Drivers #
The sensor drivers for the multimode sensor are fully documented and maintained in the project WiKi. 
You can read the sensor page Wiki [here](https://github.com/SamsungResearchUK-IoT-Meetup/projects/wiki/Sensors)

There is also a test section of the project which contains each sensor in a separate directory. 
Each directory has also a README.md file which is really the same as the Wiki for the sensors. 
It's been done like this for completeness. To find to the test directory go [here](https://github.com/SamsungResearchUK-IoT-Meetup/projects/tree/master/micropython/test-programs)
