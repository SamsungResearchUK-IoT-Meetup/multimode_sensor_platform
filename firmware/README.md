## Frimware for the MicroPython pyboard D
This folder contains the different firmware versions for the pyboard D variants.
Make sure, which hardware you are using before flashing any firmware. Currently there are three versions available.
The SF2 (blue Sticker), SF3 (pruple Sticker) and SF6 (red Sticker). In this specific project you will need threating to be enabled,
which means it's compiled into the firmware you put on the pyboard.

If you have a pybaord D with the STMF722 (blue) microcontroller make sure to use the firmware provided here.
